Key/Mouse inputs:
All of the cheat keys (provided below and the ones we had to do)
The left and right arrow move the paddle

Cheat keys:
The ones we had to do.
Pressing W automatically wins the game
Pressing F take you back to the first level.
Pressing D doubles your score 

Known Bugs:
I know that the powerup for doubling score stays at the bottom
even though it disappears, continually doubling score for some reason, the status
display doesn't update because i couldn't figure out how, the bricks
don't take different hits, they are just different colors (I couldn;t figure out how to do this)
There is also a brick in the top left of every level and I don't
know how it is getting there or how to get rid of it.

Extra credit:


### Notes/Assumptions
Only got two powerups, didn't do something specifically extra, couldn't get bricks to change hits, status display isn't functioning
properly. Also I won;t lie, this past week i really thought I was gonna drop the class but then I got a breakthrough with my code and felt more confident
and so I decided to finish and stay. It's not completely finished because I didn't try as much at first because I really thought I was gonna drop,
although I wish I could have finished completely.
